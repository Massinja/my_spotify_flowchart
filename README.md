# my_spotify_flowchart

## Project Requirements
Create a flowchart outlining how you would create a Spotify-like music service.

At a minimum, this website must have the following features:
Accounts for artists and listeners
The ability for artists to create/delete music, either as an individual song or part of an album
Ability to listen to music at random
A playlist feature that allows users to create playlists

## Solution  
Each block on the flowchart is a page with linked pages or functionality. Extra symbols I used in my chart help to understand what happens when user clicks on a certain button:

\>> will lead a user to a new page

 ^ will execute one action on the object, user will remain on the same page; this functionality is not seen on the screen until you press on a special button by the object's name

ðŸ”˜ toggle - (yes/no)

ðŸŸ¦ (blue box) opens a pop up window to make a choice, remains on the same page when the choice is done

The flowchart is available below:
